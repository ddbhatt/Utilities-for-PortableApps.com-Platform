CreateLauncher.exe

Create Launcher that 

1) launches apps based on 32 Bit or 64 Bit OS using Hard Coded Relative Paths for the exe

2) executes commands in current directory based on 32 Bit or 64 Bit OS using Hard Coded Custom Commands

3) executes embedded batch file in current directory (Note %CD% works but %~dp0 %~fp0 etc points to temp folder)
